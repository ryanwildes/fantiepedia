# Cannons

Cannons are a powerful rearguard weapon unlocked upon reaching the Alstella portion of the game.

They hit slow and hard, and attack entire groups at once. They are generally Pierce and Flame element.

Cannons increase CON and DMP. They also provide a small guard chance, and a chance to inflict Startle.
