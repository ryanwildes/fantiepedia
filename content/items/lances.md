# Lances

Lances are a versatile weapon for both the vanguard and rearguard. They can be either one or two-handed, making them good to pair with another weapon (like katars for Peer Chariots) or shields.

Almost all lances are Pierce element, though they can rarely be Blunt.

Their primary stats are STR and DEX, and all lances provide a small amount of guard chance.
