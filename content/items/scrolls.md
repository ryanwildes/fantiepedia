# Scrolls

Scrolls are a hand-to-hand weapon unlocked upon reaching the Alstella portion of the game.

They have the unique Transform element, which allows them to hit enemies for any element they're weak to. However, each attack consumes a small amount of HP or DP.

Their primary stats are CON and DEX. They also increase status resistances, guard chance, and boost EXP gained after battle.
