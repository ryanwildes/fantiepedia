# Lamps

Lamps are slow weapons for Donum-oriented facets. They are exclusively for the rearguard, and are commonly two-handed.

They are usually Blunt and one of either Flame, Mud, or Fog. However, there are a few that are rarely Pierce and Slash.

Unsurprisingly, their primary stats are Max DP and DMP. All lamps also have a small guard chance, and a chance to inflict the Abyss status.
