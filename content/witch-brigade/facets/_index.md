# Facets

When you create a puppet soldier, the first thing you'll select is its Facet.

Facets are like classes or jobs in other RPGs. Each one has unique stats, weapon proficiences, and skills that set them apart from the others.

At the start of the game, you can select from the following facets:

 - [Aster Crow]({{< relref "/witch-brigade/facets/aster-crow" >}})
 - Shinomashira
 - Theatrical Star
 - Peer Fortress
 - Wonder Corsair
 - Rapid Venator

Others are unlocked as you progress throughout the game.

## Stat Growth

## Aptitudes

Aptitudes affect stats gained from equipment. For example, if a puppet has a 125% aptitude for STR, any STR they get from equipment gets a 125% modifier.
