# Facets

When you create a puppet soldier, the first thing you'll select is its Facet.

Facets are like classes or jobs in other RPGs. Each one has unique stats, weapon proficiences, and skills that set them apart from the others.

At the start of the game, you can select from the following facets:

 - [Aster Crow]({{< relref "/witch-brigade/facets/aster-crow" >}})
 - [Shinomashira]({{< relref "/witch-brigade/facets/shinomashira" >}})
 - [Theatrical Star]({{< relref "/witch-brigade/facets/theatrical-star" >}})
 - [Peer Fortress]({{< relref "/witch-brigade/facets/peer-fortress" >}})
 - [Wonder Corsair]({{< relref "/witch-brigade/facets/wonder-corsair" >}})
 - [Rapid Venator]({{< relref "/witch-brigade/facets/rapid-venator" >}})

Others are unlocked as you progress through the story.

## Stat Growth

Each facet has ratings for each stat on how fast they will grow on level up. This growth can be accelerated or suppressed by also choosing a stat growth type on the puppet.

## Aptitudes

Aptitudes affect stats gained from equipment. For example, if a puppet has a 125% aptitude for STR, any STR they get from equipment gets a 125% modifier.

## Parameters

Coven parameters affect a bonus each puppet in a coven gets. A higher rating results in a larger percentage boost. Each pact has a different set of parameters that can be increased, as well as an upper limit.
