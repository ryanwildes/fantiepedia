# Covens

Before you can venture forth into the labyrinth, your puppet soldiers need to be organized into *covens*. A coven attacks, defends, and uses donum as a single unit, though it can be composed of up to 3 attackers and 5 supporting puppets.

# Coven Parameters

Each coven has a set of stats that can be increased by the parameters of the individual puppets.

# Secret Crests

As your puppets deal damage, they build up their coven's Liberation meter. Once it's full, the coven can use a Secret Crest action.
