# Luck

Each of your puppets has a Luck stat (abbreviated LUC). Unlike other stats, luck doesn't increase on level up, and maxes out at 99. Instead, luck is increased by equipment or skills.

A puppet is created with a random amount of luck between 0 and 99 based on their name. This appears to be based on numerology. The name can be changed later via Witch Petition.

On soul transfer, the puppet's luck will go down an amount based on their lucky number. If it goes below zero, it *wraps around* to 99 and down.

When you are over the mana limit, the luck of your entire brigade is reduced to Despair Level. It has also been suggested that your karma can affect luck and luck transferring.
