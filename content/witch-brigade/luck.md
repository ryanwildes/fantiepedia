# Luck

Each of your puppets has a luck statistic (abbreviated LUC). Unlike other stats, luck doesn't increase on levels. Instead, luck is increased through equipment or skills.

A puppet is given a random amount of luck on creation based on their name. This appears to be based on numerology. The name can be changed later via Witch Petition.

On each soul transfer, the puppet's luck will go down an amount based on their lucky number. If it goes below zero, it *wraps around* to 99 and down.

When you are over the mana limit, the luck of your entire brigade is reduced to Despair Level.

## Lucky numbers

Each soul transfer, a puppet's luck will go down an amount based on their lucky number. This can be further influenced by having the puppet wear luck increasing or decreasing gear during the transfer.

| 0            | 36     |
| 1-10         | 35     |
| 11-20        | 34     |
| 21-30        | 33     |
| 31-40        | 32     |
| 41-50        | 31     |
